                    <p class="text-gray-600">Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to website owners. Cookies are not programs and cannot carry viruses or install malware. They typically contain the name of the originating domain, a unique identifier, and some digits and numbers that allow the website to recognize your actions and preferences over time.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-4">1.2 How Cookies Work</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">When you visit a website, the server sends small bits of data (cookies) to your browser which stores them according to the domain rules. When you return to the same site, your browser sends these cookies back to the server, allowing the site to "remember" your previous interactions. First-party cookies are set by the website you're visiting, while third-party cookies come from other domains that provide content or features on the page. Cookies can have different lifespans, ranging from "session cookies" that expire when you close your browser to "persistent cookies" that remain for a set period or until manually deleted.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">These essential cookies are required for the website to function properly and cannot be switched off. They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. Without these cookies, services you've asked for cannot be provided. These cookies don't collect personal information, and they're typically set in response to actions made by you such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. We use strictly necessary cookies to maintain user sessions, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and ensure secure shopping cart and checkout processes.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. They allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve site performance. Performance cookies help us identify the most and least popular pages and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you don't allow these cookies, we can't know when you've visited our site and won't be able to monitor its performance or identify potential issues.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Functional cookies enable enhanced functionality and personalization such as live chats and remembering your preferences. They may be set by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party providers whose services we've added to our pages (third-party cookies). For example, we use functional cookies to remember your location preferences (such as language or region) so you don't have to keep re-entering them. Without these cookies, some services you've asked for may not function properly, and you may experience less optimized navigation between pages.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests. They work by uniquely identifying your browser and device but don't collect personal data like your name. The information obtained may be used to send you relevant advertising on other sites and measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. If you don't allow these cookies, you'll experience less targeted advertising. We use targeting cookies to limit how many times you see an ad and to measure campaign effectiveness (advertising cookies).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">We use Google Analytics to understand how our website is used and measure site performance. Google Analytics sets cookies that collect information about how visitors use our site, including pages visited and time spent. This helps us improve site navigation and content. The data is collected anonymously and includes the number of visitors, where they come from, and pages visited. We've configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses and disabled data sharing with Google. You can opt out using Google's opt-out browser add-on or through our cookie management tool.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">The Facebook Pixel helps us understand the effectiveness of our Facebook advertising by tracking conversions from Facebook ads. It uses cookies to track actions visitors take after viewing or clicking on a Facebook ad. This data helps us optimize our advertising strategy and show ads to people who are most likely to be interested in our services. The Facebook Pixel tracks events such as page views, form submissions, and purchases. We don't receive personal data from Facebook, just aggregated reports. You can control your Facebook ad preferences in your Facebook account settings.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">If you use our live chat feature, cookies are used to remember your chat history and preferences so you don't have to repeat information. These cookies help our support team provide better service by maintaining context across pages. They remember whether you've been helped before and can connect you with the same representative if appropriate. The cookies also help us analyze chat performance to improve our customer service. If you prefer not to use cookies for the live chat, you can still contact us through other methods like phone or email.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain only until you close your browser. These are essential for secure areas of our website and enable features like remembering items in your shopping cart or maintaining your logged-in status. They help maintain security by ensuring that session information isn't stored on your device longer than necessary. Session cookies don't collect information from your computer and are deleted immediately when you end your session. Without these cookies, many website functions wouldn't operate correctly, and security might be compromised.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Most web browsers allow control of cookies through their settings. You can typically find these in the 'Options' or 'Preferences' menu. Common options include accepting all cookies, being notified when a cookie is set, or rejecting all cookies. However, blocking all cookies might affect website functionality as some are essential for core features. Browser settings typically allow you to delete existing cookies and control whether new ones can be set. For more specific instructions, consult your browser's help documentation. Note that cookie preferences are browser-specific, so you'll need to adjust settings in each browser you use.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Several industry associations offer tools to help manage online behavioral advertising preferences. These tools allow you to opt out of targeted ads from member companies. In the US, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out page, and in Europe, the EDAA's Your Online Choices site provides similar functionality. These programs don't block all ads, just those delivered through targeted cookie-based advertising. They work by placing an opt-out cookie to indicate your preferences, which means you'll need to repeat the process if you clear cookies. We participate in these programs to provide you with more control over your online experience.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">On mobile devices, cookie management may be handled through device settings rather than browser settings, especially when using apps. Both iOS and Android provide privacy controls that affect cookie behavior. The exact steps vary by device and operating system version, but you can typically find these settings under "Privacy" or "Site Settings" menus. Some mobile browsers provide enhanced cookie controls specific to third-party cookies. Mobile ad IDs can also be reset or disabled to limit tracking across apps. Remember that mobile browsers may handle cookies differently than desktop browsers even on the same website.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Persistent cookies remain on your device for a set period specified in the cookie or until manually deleted. These cookies enable websites to remember your preferences across multiple visits. Our persistent cookies typically have expiration dates ranging from 30 days to 2 years depending on their purpose. Analytics and advertising cookies often have longer durations to track usage patterns over time, while preference cookies may expire more quickly as your settings could change. The expiration is set in advance, and the cookie stops functioning after this date. You can delete persistent cookies manually through your browser settings at any time.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Session cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser. They're essential for fundamental site functions like keeping you logged in during your visit or remembering items in your shopping cart. Since they don't persist, they must be recreated each time you visit the site. Session cookies contain no personally identifiable information and are more secure as they don't remain on your device. However, they can't provide continuity between browsing sessions. Some websites may use session cookies to enhance user experience by remembering your preferences during a single visit, but they will not track your activity once you leave the site.</p>
